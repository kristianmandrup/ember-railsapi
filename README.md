# Ember - RailsAPI

This is an example app I have been building to test out using
[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) and
[RailsAPI](https://github.com/rails-api)

This is a work in progress.

## Run it

1. Bundle

`$ bundle`


2. Setup database

`$ rake db:migrate`

3. Start server

`$ rails s`

4. See it in action :)

`$ open http://localhost:3000`

Enjoy!
